# tags deprecated

both tags `deprecated` and `beta` are removed from this page

***





This page tests the `deprecated` tag as a primary tag alongside a secondary tag.

* **Deprecated** (primary, emoji: ⚠️) — marked as `primary: true`
* **Beta** (emoji: 🎉) — secondary tag, simple string reference
